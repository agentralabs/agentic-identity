# Security Policy

Report vulnerabilities via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting.
DO NOT open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

We care about: identity key material protection, .aid file integrity,
receipt chain tamper resistance, trust grant verification, MCP server
sandbox bypasses, privilege escalation via spawn authority, and
cryptographic implementation correctness.
