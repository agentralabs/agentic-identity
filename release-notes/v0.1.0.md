## Executive Summary

AgenticIdentity v0.1.0 is the initial release of the cryptographic trust anchor for AI agents. It delivers seven core inventions: identity anchors rooted in Ed25519 key pairs, signed action receipts that produce tamper-evident audit trails, a trust web with scoped capability grants and revocation, temporal continuity chains for proving agent persistence across sessions, identity inheritance through bounded child spawning, competence proofs that let agents demonstrate domain proficiency, and negative capability proofs that let agents cryptographically prove what they cannot do. The library ships as four Rust crates (core, CLI, MCP server, FFI bindings) plus a Python package, all validated by 289 tests including scale, concurrency, and resilience suites.

## Business Impact

This release provides the foundational identity layer that multi-agent systems need to move from trusted-by-assumption to verified-by-default. Teams deploying AI agents in production gain non-repudiable action logging (every agent decision, observation, and mutation is signed and chained), scoped permission management (trust grants with capability URIs, time bounds, use limits, and delegation depth), and revocation without shared-secret rotation (individual grants are revoked independently). The temporal continuity and spawn inheritance features enable long-running agent workflows where identity persists across restarts, model switches, and parent-child delegation chains with enforced authority bounding. Competence and negative capability proofs add a new dimension of agent accountability that is unique to the AgenticOS ecosystem.

## Rollout Guidance

Publish the core `agentic-identity` crate first and verify availability on crates.io before publishing downstream crates. After core propagation (approximately 45 seconds), publish `agentic-identity-cli` and `agentic-identity-mcp` in sequence, each with retry logic to handle crates.io index propagation delays. The `agentic-identity-ffi` crate can be published last as it serves the Python binding layer. Validate MCP server registration in Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP clients before broad rollout. For Python consumers, ensure the FFI shared library builds correctly on the target platform before advertising pip install availability.
