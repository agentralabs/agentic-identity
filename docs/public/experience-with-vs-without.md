# Experience: With vs Without AgenticIdentity

## Without AgenticIdentity

- AI agent actions are anonymous and untraceable
- No way to verify who or what performed an action
- Trust relationships are implicit and unenforceable
- No audit trail for agent decisions
- Rogue agents cannot be identified or revoked
- Multi-agent collaboration lacks authentication

## With AgenticIdentity

- Every agent action is cryptographically signed
- Receipts provide tamper-evident audit trails
- Trust delegations are explicit, scoped, and revocable
- Agent identity persists across sessions via continuity chains
- Child agents inherit verifiable lineage from parent
- Any MCP client can verify action authenticity
